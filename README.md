# 3D Game
 
A very simple level about keeping your mouse steady.

WASD = to move
R = to reset

I didn't know how to add text into a 3D space so I put the directions here and the reset is in case you fall. I didn't realize how to put in a win con based on proximity so if you reach the other building, you win and if you fall, you lose. If I could, I would add swaying to the rope.
